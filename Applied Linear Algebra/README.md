# Applied Linear Algebra

This Folder contains theoretical and practical homeworks that we designed for Applied Linear Algebra students.

The topics of the course contains:
1. Vectors, Norm and distance, Vector space, Matrices
2. Linear independence and Linear Equations
3. Least squares
4. Eigen values and eigen vectors
5. Singular values and singular vectors
6.Singular value decomposition (SVD)
7. Spectral Clustering

Here is the list of homeworks:

## Practical Homeworks
- Gram-Schmidt process
- The Least Square algorithm
- Orthogonal projections
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- PageRank Algorithm
- TextRank: Bringing order into text ([this](https://aclanthology.org/W04-3252/) paper.)
